# kelvinlee.dev V2

Version 2 of my personal website. This project allowed me to try out some new tools and explore with some more design.

### ðŸ”¨ Tools used

- [Astro](https://astro.build): bundles static assets with dynamic, configurable hydration options. This site is all static at the moment, almost no JS. The development experience is very FAST, really enjoyed the process. Will definitely use this more in the future.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for styled-components.

### ðŸš€ Running Astro Locally

```bash
# dev
npm install
npm run dev

# build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Feel free to check out [their documentation](https://docs.astro.build) or jump into their [Discord server](https://astro.build/chat).
