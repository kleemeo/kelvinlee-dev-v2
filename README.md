# kelvinlee.dev v2

v2 of my personal website. This project allowed me to try out some new tools and explore with more minimalistic design. Wanted to go with something that was simple and performant. This site is all static at the moment, almost zero JS (except for the dark mode toggle and the hobbies caption). The DX was extremely good and I'm really happy with the result.
