Currently helping a large enterprise improve their day-to-day operations by upgrading their legacy software to a modern web-app based solution.

As an engineer, my goal is to build beautiful and meaningful web experiences via performant code. <span class="react">React with Typescript</span> is my specialty and I love exploring exciting new tools such as Vite, Next, Remix, Solid, Astro and more.

I love the outdoors and staying active but currently recovering from a torn achilles sustained from playing soccer ⚽️☹️
