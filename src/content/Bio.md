title: Bio

I am currently helping large enterprises upgrade from legacy to modern web applications in an agile consulting team. My goal is to build beautiful and meaningful web experiences via performant code.

<span class="react">React with Typescript</span> is my specialty and I love exploring all the new tools such as Vite, Next, Remix, Solid, Astro and more.

I love the outdoors and staying active but currently recovering from a torn achilles sustained from playing soccer ☹️
